# Modern Dark Theme for Media Monkey

![Screenshot_1](/Screenshots/Screenshot_1.png)

Modern Dark is a theme/skin for the [Media Monkey Plyer ](http://www.mediamonkey.com/). It uses dark colors and [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) to give it a modern look. It is based of the default Metro M skin.

### How do I install it?

1. Create a .zip file containing the content of this repository (except this [Readme](README.md) and the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file) or get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/hendrikbl/modern-dark-theme/releases)
2. Change the file extension from `.zip` to `.msz`
3. Place the `.msz` in your Skins folder (either `Program Files (x86)\MediaMonkey\Skins` or `%AppData%\MediaMonkey\Skins`)
4. Run Media Monkey and go to `Tools -> Options`
5. On the left scroll all the way down to Skin, select the Skin from the list and click OK
6. Sometimes the skin is not fully applied, so you should restart Media Monkay to make shure everything works
7. Enjoy the Skin!

### TODO

The Skin isn't 100% finished (and probably never will), but here are some things I am aware of:

- RadioButtons
- Icons/Images
- TextSelection Color
- ScrollBars
- Buttons
- Song Notification
- Mini Player
- Autotag from Web Background

### Contributing

If you find an element which is not skinned or looks strange, please create an issue. If you want to fix it yourself, go ahead. You can find a guide on how to skin Media Monkey [here](http://www.mediamonkey.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_skin_MediaMonkey_v3.0_and_higher).
